# Code Review — PR #4 (TKT-021)

## Summary

The PR correctly implements the seven PRD-003 modality tables (`water_events`, `sleep_records`, `sleep_pairing_state`, `workout_events`, `mood_events`, `modality_settings`, `modality_settings_audit`) with RLS policies, indexes, and right-to-delete cascade extension. All DDL uses `IF NOT EXISTS` guards for idempotency, all RLS policies follow the existing `app.user_id`::uuid pattern, and the right-to-delete cascade includes all seven new tables in FK-safe order. However, ARCH-001 §5.3 declares `user_id: bigint` for these tables while the actual `users.id` is UUID — the executor correctly used UUID to maintain FK integrity but did not escalate this ArchSpec inconsistency via a Q-file as required by CONTRIBUTING.md executor guardrails.

## Verdict
- [ ] pass
- [ ] pass_with_changes
- [x] fail

One-sentence justification: ArchSpec §5.3 declares `user_id: bigint` for all seven modality tables but the actual `users.id` is UUID — the executor used UUID (the only FK-compatible choice) but did not file a Q-TKT-021-*.md to escalate the inconsistency per CONTRIBUTING.md § Executor guardrails.

Recommendation to PO: **escalate-to-architect** — the code is the only correct implementation; the ArchSpec §5.3 needs correction from `bigint` to `uuid_fk_users` to match §5 general convention. Once the Architect confirms, no code changes are needed.

## Contract compliance (each must be ticked or marked finding)
- [x] PR modifies ONLY files listed in TKT §5 Outputs (plus supporting code changes for right-to-delete cascade and migration tooling, which are within §2 In Scope)
- [x] No changes to TKT §3 NOT-In-Scope items (no C16-C22 component implementations, no business logic, no modifications to existing PRD-001/PRD-002 table definitions)
- [x] No new runtime dependencies beyond TKT §7 Constraints allowlist (package.json diff is empty)
- [ ] All Acceptance Criteria from TKT §6 are verifiably satisfied — **F-H1**: AC §6 line 64 specifies `user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id')::bigint` but code uses `current_setting('app.user_id')::uuid` (correctly matching repo convention, but diverging from ArchSpec §5.3 and ticket AC)
- [x] CI green (lint, typecheck, tests all pass per executor §10 log)
- [x] Definition of Done complete (all DoD checkboxes satisfied)
- [x] Ticket frontmatter `status: in_review` present in diff (line 9: `status: ready` → `status: in_review`)

## Findings

### High (blocking)

- **F-H1 (ARCH-001 §5.3 lines 1141–1207, ADR-017 §Decision lines 180/196, TKT-021 AC §6 line 64):** ArchSpec §5.3 declares `user_id: bigint NOT NULL` (or `bigint PK`) for all seven modality tables. ADR-017 §Decision also declares `user_id: bigint` for `sleep_records` (line 180) and `sleep_pairing_state` (line 196). The executor used `user_id UUID` to match the existing repo convention (`users.id UUID PRIMARY KEY` at schema.sql:105, all existing FKs use `user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id)`). The UUID choice is the **only FK-compatible implementation** — using `bigint` would fail at DDL time because PostgreSQL cannot implicitly cast `bigint` to `uuid` for a FK reference. However, the executor did **not** file a `Q-TKT-021-*.md` to escalate this ArchSpec inconsistency, violating CONTRIBUTING.md § Executor guardrails: "If a Ticket is ambiguous or contradicts the ArchSpec, Executor MUST stop and create `docs/questions/Q-TKT-XXX-NN.md` before writing code." *Responsible role:* Executor. *Suggested remediation:* File a Q-file. The Architect should correct ARCH-001 §5.3 from `user_id: bigint` to `user_id: uuid_fk_users` (matching §5 general convention at lines 885/900/915/…) and update the ticket AC §6 line 64 from `::bigint` to `::uuid`.

### Medium

- **F-M1 (tests/db/prd003_modality_schema.test.ts, tests/db/prd003_right_to_delete.test.ts):** Both test files read `schema.sql` and migration SQL as strings and verify DDL/DML patterns with regex/string matching. They do NOT execute against a real PostgreSQL instance. The ticket AC §6 line 64 references verification "via `pg_class.relrowsecurity`" and line 65 references "`pg_indexes`", which implies real DB execution against `pg_catalog`. The repo has no testcontainers or integration DB test infrastructure (no other `tests/db/*.test.ts` files exist). The tests provide value as regression guards for SQL text correctness, but do not verify actual RLS enforcement, constraint behavior, or cascade deletion. If the project later adds testcontainers, these tests should be upgraded to integration tests.

- **F-M2 (migrations/004_prd003_right_to_delete_cascade.sql):** This migration file (14 lines) contains **only SQL comments** — no executable DDL. The actual right-to-delete cascade extension is implemented in TypeScript (`src/privacy/rightToDelete.ts:createDeletionSqlByTable()`). The ticket §5 Outputs says this file should "extend the existing `/forget_me` cascade to include the seven new tables." While the TypeScript extension is correct and complete, the SQL migration file is a misleading no-op. Either it should contain the actual SQL DELETE statements (matching the TypeScript), or the ticket §5 Outputs description should be clarified to note it's a documentation marker.

### Low

- **F-L1 (src/store/schema.sql:576–577):** The GRANT statements were modified to include the seven new tables alongside existing tables in a single long line. While functionally correct, the line is now 300+ characters. A separate GRANT for the new tables (as done in migration 003 lines 187–188) would be more readable and diff-friendly.

## Red-team probes (Reviewer must address each)

- **Error paths:** Not applicable — this is a data-model-only ticket (migrations, RLS, indexes). No runtime error paths to handle. DDL uses `IF NOT EXISTS` / `DO $$ ... END $$` guards for idempotency. The `loadMigrationFiles()` function (migrations.ts:69–85) handles missing `migrations/` directory gracefully by returning `[]`.
- **Concurrency:** Not applicable — schema DDL is applied at startup via `runMigrations()`. No concurrent DDL concern. The `loadMigrationFiles()` function reads and applies files sequentially in sorted order.
- **Input validation:** CHECK constraints on columns are correct per ARCH-001 §5.3: `volume_ml > 0 AND <= 5000` (water_events:383), `duration_min >= 30 AND <= 1440` (sleep_records:397), `score >= 1 AND <= 10` (mood_events:440), `comment_text IS NULL OR length(comment_text) <= 280` (mood_events:441), `distance_km IS NULL OR > 0` (workout_events:423).
- **Prompt injection:** Not applicable — no LLM interaction in this ticket. No user text reaches any LLM. No external strings are processed.
- **Tenant isolation:** All seven tables have RLS enabled (`ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` at schema.sql:490–496) with `FOR ALL USING (current_setting('app.user_id')::uuid = user_id) WITH CHECK (...)` policies (schema.sql:551–571), matching the existing repo pattern (e.g., schema.sql:501). The `kbju_app` role has CRUD, `kbju_audit` has SELECT. `BYPASSRLS` is not granted to `kbju_app`. ✓
- **Secrets:** No credentials committed. No `.env` changes. No new environment variables. No secrets in SQL or TypeScript. ✓
- **Observability:** Not applicable — no runtime code or observability events in this ticket. Future TKT-026 will add emit-boundary redaction for the new `raw_text`/`raw_workout_text`/`raw_description` columns.
- **Rollback:** The DDL is idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`) but no `DROP TABLE` / down migration is provided. Rollback would require manual `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` statements for the seven new tables. The ticket doesn't explicitly require down migrations, but the AC §6 line 63 says "Migration up + down tested: `npm run migrate:up && npm run migrate:down && npm run migrate:up`" — this AC cannot be satisfied without a down migration. This is a sub-finding of F-M1 (tests don't verify this AC).
